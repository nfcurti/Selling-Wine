      "description": "Amarone della Valpolicella Dal Moro was born in Negrar, in the heart of Valpolicella, from vineyards located at an altitude of 150-450 meters above sea level. \n The blend is typical of the denomination and includes the indigenous Corvina Veronese, Corvinone and Rondinella vines with a clear prevalence of the first variety. It has drying in the fruit cellar for 120 days, then alcoholic fermentation and aging in wood for at least 24 months. \n Red with a dense and compact garnet color, it releases an intense and persistent scent of ether and ripe red fruit which evolves after a while in black cherry under spirit and dried plum. The taste is structured and soft, which is counterpointed by a velvety tannicity. \n Ideal in combination with all types of grilled red meat, braised meats and cheeses characterized by long aging.",
